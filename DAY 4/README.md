## 🏆 Key Learnings

### **1️⃣ Understanding & Exploring Data Bias**
- Asked ChatGPT to generate examples related to left-handed individuals.
- Identified potential biases in AI-generated responses, such as assumptions that most people are right-handed.
- Researched common AI biases including:
  - **Gender Bias**: AI models sometimes reinforce stereotypes.

📌 **Outcome:** A documented list of biases found in AI-generated responses.

---

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Exploration**
- Loaded and preprocessed the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.
- Identified potential **bias-inducing columns** such as:
  - **Gender**: May impact churn predictions unfairly.
  - **Senior Citizen Status**: Could introduce age-related bias.
  - **Payment Method**: Some methods may correlate with financial accessibility issues.

📌 **Outcome:** A list of columns that could introduce bias and their possible effects.

---

### **3️⃣ Customer Segmentation**
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing values.
- Grouped customers based on **demographic, geographic, and usage behaviors**.
- Used **visualization techniques**  to present findings.

📌 **Outcome:** A segmentation report with customer group insights and visualizations.

---

### **4️⃣ Identifying Customer Churn Indicators**
- Conducted **correlation analysis** to find key features impacting churn.
- Gained insights into **why certain customers are more likely to churn**.

📌 **Outcome:** A list of top predictors of customer churn.
